# Configuration Files

## What Is Here
- .zshrc -> configuration for zsh, all my paths and configs and everything
- .config -> directory that holds configs for a bunch of stuff
- .tmux and .tmux.conf -> holds all of my tmux configs and plugins

## Installing This
Clone it down, symlink everything from this directory over to $HOME. Then install Packer and do packer sync in the .config/nvim folder, install the tmux plugins, do all that stuff.
