You initially tried to run `go --version`, which resulted in an error message because the correct flag is `-version` (single dash) or just `version` as a subcommand.\n\n2. The error message provided a list of available Go commands and help topics.\n\n3. You then correctly ran `go version`, which showed:\n   `go version go1.23.0 darwin/arm64`\n\n   This indicates that:\n   - You're running Go version 1.23.0\n   - Your operating system is macOS (darwin)\n   - Your CPU architecture is arm64 (likely an Apple Silicon Mac)\n\n4. Your current directory path is shown as:\n   `~/Development/go-projects/silverbadger main`\n\n   This suggests you're in a Go project directory named \"silverbadger\" on the \"main\" branch (possibly a Git repository).\n\n5. The prompt symbol `❯` suggests you might be using a custom shell prompt, possibly with a tool like Oh My Zsh or a similar shell customization.\n\nThis output gives a good overview of your Go installation and current working environment for Go development on your Mac.\nThanks\nYou're welcome! I'm glad I could help you interpret the terminal output. If you have any more questions about Go, your development environment, or anything else related to programming, feel free to ask. Good luck with your Go projects!\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":61}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":14},"start":2257,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":62}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":15},"start":3331,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":63}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":53},"start":3338,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":64}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":54},"start":3574,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":65}},"image_offsets":[]}],"summary":"Go version check and command list on macOS ARM64","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default"},{"range":{"start":49,"end":2255},"icon":"Terminal","label":"Terminal"}]}
