In Go, there are a few ways to loop over an array of integers. Here are the most common methods:\n\n1. Using a traditional for loop:\n\n```go\nnumbers := [5]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nfor i := 0; i < len(numbers); i++ {\n    fmt.Println(numbers[i])\n}\n```\n\n2. Using the range keyword (which is often preferred):\n\n```go\nnumbers := [5]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nfor index, value := range numbers {\n    fmt.Printf(\"Index: %d, Value: %d\\n\", index, value)\n}\n```\n\nIf you don't need the index, you can use an underscore to ignore it:\n\n```go\nnumbers := [5]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nfor _, value := range numbers {\n    fmt.Println(value)\n}\n```\n\n3. If you're working with a slice instead of an array, the syntax is the same:\n\n```go\nnumbers := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\nfor _, value := range numbers {\n    fmt.Println(value)\n}\n```\n\nThe `range` form is generally more idiomatic in Go and is often preferred when you need both the index and value, or when you only need the value. The traditional `for` loop is useful when you need more control over the iteration process.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":13}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":7},"start":66,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":14}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":8},"start":1102,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":15}},"image_offsets":[]}],"summary":"Looping over integer arrays in Go","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default"}]}
