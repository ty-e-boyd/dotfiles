{"id":"72713b9d-33c9-44df-92ff-27ac90ec0e39","zed":"context","version":"0.4.0","text":"using zed, once I have added my own keybinds to the keymap.json, how do I actually make zed recognize those keys\nOnce you've added your own keybinds to the `keymap.json` file, Zed should automatically recognize and apply these new keybindings the next time you start the editor. However, if you want to apply the changes without restarting Zed, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Open the Command Palette:\n   - On macOS: Press `Cmd+Shift+P`\n   - On Windows/Linux: Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`\n\n2. Type \"Reload Window\" in the Command Palette and select the \"Reload Window\" option when it appears.\n\n3. Zed will reload, applying your new keybindings.\n\nIf you're still having issues with Zed recognizing your custom keybinds after reloading, try these troubleshooting steps:\n\n1. Double-check your `keymap.json` file for any syntax errors. Make sure all brackets, commas, and quotes are correctly placed.\n\n2. Ensure that the keybindings you've added don't conflict with existing keybindings. Zed might prioritize default keybindings over custom ones in case of conflicts.\n\n3. Verify that you're editing the correct `keymap.json` file. The location of this file can vary depending on your operating system:\n   - On macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Zed/keymap.json`\n   - On Linux: `~/.config/Zed/keymap.json`\n   - On Windows: `%APPDATA%\\Zed\\keymap.json`\n\n4. If you're still having issues, try completely closing Zed (including any background processes) and reopening it.\n\n5. As a last resort, you can try resetting Zed's configuration and then re-adding your custom keybindings.\n\nIf none of these steps work, there might be an issue with how the keybindings are defined in your `keymap.json` file. In that case, you may want to review Zed's documentation or seek help from the Zed community forums or GitHub issues page.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":34}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":28},"start":113,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":35}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":29},"start":1808,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":36}},"image_offsets":[]}],"summary":"Adding custom keybinds to Zed editor","slash_command_output_sections":[]}
