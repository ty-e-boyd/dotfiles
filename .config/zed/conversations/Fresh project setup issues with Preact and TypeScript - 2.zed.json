I am getting these errors. Can you help me diagnose this?\nIt looks like you're encountering some issues related to TypeScript and React in your Fresh project. Fresh is built on Preact, not React, and uses Deno, which has some differences from a typical Node.js environment. Let's address these issues:\n\n1. `@preact/signals` error:\n   Make sure you have the correct dependencies installed. In Fresh, you typically don't need to manually install packages. Check your `import_map.json` file to ensure it includes the correct mapping for `@preact/signals`.\n\n2. \"Cannot find name 'React'\" errors:\n   These errors occur because Fresh uses Preact, not React. You don't need to import React explicitly. Fresh provides the necessary Preact components and hooks out of the box.\n\nTo resolve these issues:\n\n1. Remove any explicit React imports if you have them.\n2. Make sure your `import_map.json` file includes the necessary mappings, especially for `@preact/signals`.\n3. If you're using any React-specific features, replace them with their Preact equivalents.\n\nHere's how your `index.tsx` file should look:\n\n```tsx\nimport { useSignal } from \"@preact/signals\";\nimport Counter from \"../islands/Counter.tsx\";\n\nexport default function Home() {\n  const count = useSignal(3);\n  return (\n    <div class=\"px-4 py-8 mx-auto bg-[#86efac]\">\n      <div class=\"max-w-screen-md mx-auto flex flex-col items-center justify-center\">\n        <img\n          class=\"my-6\"\n          src=\"/logo.svg\"\n          alt=\"the Fresh logo: a sliced lemon dripping with juice\"\n        />\n        <h1 class=\"text-4xl font-bold\">Welcome to Fresh</h1>\n        <p class=\"my-4\">\n          Try updating this message in the\n          <code class=\"mx-2\">./routes/index.tsx</code> file, and refresh.\n        </p>\n        <Counter count={count} />\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nAlso, ensure that your `deno.json` or `fresh.config.ts` file is properly configured.\n\nIf you're still encountering issues:\n1. Make sure you're using the latest version of Fresh.\n2. Try running `deno cache --reload` to refresh your dependencies.\n3. Check that your TypeScript configuration is correct for a Fresh project.\n\nIf the problems persist, you might want to compare your project structure with a fresh installation of a Fresh project to spot any differences.\nSo this actually is a brand new fresh app, created by their cli. I haven't changed anything yet, and I'm getting those errors. I tried reloading the deno cache, and the errors are still showing up. Any other ideas?\nI see. If this is a brand new Fresh app created by the CLI and you haven't made any changes, yet you're still seeing these errors, it's quite unusual. Let's try a few more troubleshooting steps:\n\n1. IDE Configuration:\n   These errors might be coming from your IDE's TypeScript service rather than Deno itself. Make sure your IDE is configured to use Deno:\n\n   - If you're using VS Code, install the official Deno extension and ensure it's enabled for your workspace.\n   - In your VS Code settings (either user or workspace), add:\n     ```json\n     {\n       \"deno.enable\": true,\n       \"deno.lint\": true,\n     }\n     ```\n\n2. Deno Version:\n   Ensure you have the latest version of Deno installed. Run:\n   ```\n   deno --version\n   ```\n   If it's not the latest, update Deno.\n\n3. Fresh Version:\n   Check if you're using the latest version of Fresh. You can do this by looking at the `fresh.gen.ts` file in your project root. The comment at the top should indicate the Fresh version.\n\n4. Clear Deno Cache:\n   Try clearing the Deno cache completely:\n   ```\n   deno cache --reload --lock=deno.lock\n   ```\n\n5. Regenerate Fresh files:\n   Run the Fresh init command again in your project directory:\n   ```\n   deno run -A -r https://fresh.deno.dev/update .\n   ```\n\n6. TypeScript Configuration:\n   Check if there's a `tsconfig.json` file in your project. If there is, make sure it's correctly configured for a Fresh project.\n\n7. Import Map:\n   Verify that your `import_map.json` file (or the imports section in `deno.json`) contains the correct mappings, especially for `@preact/signals`.\n\n8. Try in a Different Editor:\n   If possible, try opening the project in a different code editor to see if the errors persist.\n\n9. Fresh Project Integrity:\n   As a last resort, you could try creating a new Fresh project in a different directory and comparing the files and configurations with your current project.\n\nIf after trying these steps you're still encountering issues, it might be worth reporting this as a potential bug to the Fresh GitHub repository, providing details about your environment (OS, Deno version, Fresh version, IDE, etc.).\nI'm using the Zed editor. Is there a setting in that editor I need to change? My imports are in deno.json and are correct.\nAh, I see. You're using the Zed editor, which is relatively new and has some differences in configuration compared to more established editors like VS Code. Here's what you can try for Zed:\n\n1. Deno Language Server:\n   Zed should automatically detect and use the Deno language server for Deno projects. However, you might need to ensure it's properly configured:\n\n   - Open Zed's settings (Cmd+, on Mac or Ctrl+, on Windows/Linux)\n   - Search for \"Deno\"\n   - Make sure \"Enable Deno Language Server\" is checked\n\n2. Project Configuration:\n   Zed uses a `.zed` folder in your project root for project-specific settings. Create a file named `settings.json` inside this folder if it doesn't exist already:\n\n   ```\n   mkdir -p .zed\n   touch .zed/settings.json\n   ```\n\n   Then add the following to `.zed/settings.json`:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"deno\": {\n       \"enable\": true,\n       \"config\": \"./deno.json\",\n       \"suggest\": {\n         \"imports\": {\n           \"hosts\": {\n             \"https://deno.land\": true\n           }\n         }\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. Restart Zed:\n   After making these changes, completely close and reopen Zed.\n\n4. Manual LSP Restart:\n   If the errors persist, you can try manually restarting the language server:\n   - Open the command palette (Cmd+Shift+P on Mac or Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux)\n   - Type \"Restart language servers\" and select that option\n\n5. Clear Zed's Cache:\n   As a more drastic step, you can try clearing Zed's cache:\n   - Close Zed\n   - Remove the Zed cache directory:\n     - On macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Zed`\n     - On Linux: `~/.config/Zed`\n     - On Windows: `%APPDATA%\\Zed`\n   - Reopen Zed\n\n6. Update Zed:\n   Ensure you're using the latest version of Zed, as newer versions may have improved Deno support.\n\n7. Deno Configuration:\n   Double-check your `deno.json` file to ensure it includes the correct import map and compiler options for Fresh:\n\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"imports\": {\n       \"$fresh/\": \"https://deno.land/x/fresh@1.5.4/\",\n       \"preact\": \"https://esm.sh/preact@10.18.1\",\n       \"preact/\": \"https://esm.sh/preact@10.18.1/\",\n       \"preact-render-to-string\": \"https://esm.sh/*preact-render-to-string@6.2.2\",\n       \"@preact/signals\": \"https://esm.sh/*@preact/signals@1.2.1\",\n       \"@preact/signals-core\": \"https://esm.sh/*@preact/signals-core@1.5.0\"\n     },\n     \"compilerOptions\": {\n       \"jsx\": \"react-jsx\",\n       \"jsxImportSource\": \"preact\"\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n   (Note: The version numbers might be different depending on your Fresh version)\n\nIf after trying these steps you're still seeing errors, it might be worth reaching out to the Zed community or support channels, as there might be specific quirks with Deno and Fresh support in Zed that need addressing.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":286}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":31},"start":2044,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":287}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":32},"start":4284,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":288}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":122},"start":4499,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":289}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":123},"start":6626,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":290}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":250},"start":6749,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":291}},"image_offsets":[]},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":251},"start":9496,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":292}},"image_offsets":[]}],"summary":"Fresh project setup issues with Preact and TypeScript","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default"},{"range":{"start":3,"end":1891},"icon":"ExclamationTriangle","label":"Diagnostics: 8 errors"},{"range":{"start":15,"end":1890},"icon":"File","label":"the-fresh-prince/routes/index.tsx"},{"range":{"start":49,"end":238},"icon":"XCircle","label":"Cannot find module '@preact/signals' or its corresponding type declarations."},{"range":{"start":239,"end":474},"icon":"XCircle","label":"Cannot find name 'React'."},{"range":{"start":475,"end":703},"icon":"XCircle","label":"Cannot find name 'React'."},{"range":{"start":704,"end":947},"icon":"XCircle","label":"Cannot find name 'React'."},{"range":{"start":948,"end":1201},"icon":"XCircle","label":"Cannot find name 'React'."},{"range":{"start":1202,"end":1462},"icon":"XCircle","label":"Cannot find name 'React'."},{"range":{"start":1463,"end":1698},"icon":"XCircle","label":"Cannot find name 'React'."},{"range":{"start":1699,"end":1890},"icon":"XCircle","label":"Cannot find name 'React'."}]}
