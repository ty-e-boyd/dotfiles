So if there are 4 version numbers for a row, it'll create four rows, giving each one one of the four version numbers. It is correctly splitting, but it is assigning everything the final version number, whatever it is. Can you tell why it's overwriting with the final number? Instead of giving one per?\n\nThe issue arises because `dupeRow` is not a true duplicate of `row`. Instead, it is a reference to the same object in memory. When you modify `dupeRow`, you are also modifying `row`. As a result, all the rows end up with the last version number.\n\nTo fix this, you need to create a true copy of `row` for each version. You can achieve this by using the spread operator to create a shallow copy of the array.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```svelte\nrowData.forEach((row) => {\n    console.log(\"row\", row);\n\n    row[5]\n        .split(\" \")\n        .join(\",\")\n        .split(\",\")\n        .forEach((version) => {\n            console.log(\"version\", version);\n            let dupeRow = [...row]; // Create a shallow copy of the row\n            dupeRow[5] = version.toString();\n            rowsToAdd = [...rowsToAdd, dupeRow];\n        });\n});\n```\n\nBy using `let dupeRow = [...row];`, you ensure that `dupeRow` is a new array with the same elements as `row`, and modifying `dupeRow` will not affect the original `row`. This way, each version gets its own row correctly.\nthat worked, thanks bro\nYou're welcome! I'm glad to hear that it worked. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.
