{"display":"No, don't work on anyting right now, I just want to know what all we have done here, and what are the next items. DOn't code, just tell me","pastedContents":{},"timestamp":1759117962235,"project":"/Users/tylerboyd/Development/restoration_apparel_company"}
{"display":"So we haven't started implementing the spec at all? Are you positive?","pastedContents":{},"timestamp":1759118034829,"project":"/Users/tylerboyd/Development/restoration_apparel_company"}
{"display":"before we do anything, I've switched back to our resto-api branch we were using for this, and I pulled main, and I have some conflicts. Can you fix these conflicts? try to keep everything relevant, and right now, the stuff we are pulling from main is neccessary and working, so keep that in mind, don't just ditch changes from main","pastedContents":{},"timestamp":1759118396231,"project":"/Users/tylerboyd/Development/restoration_apparel_company"}

{"display":"So looking at this now, and the front end express-creator, what was the next step? Are we ready to start trying to test?

{"display":"Can you walk me through the entire workflow in regards to the resto-api? What is the pipelines flow?

{"display":"Last question for now, when the backend is done, and has a completed design, I know it will send that back to the front end, but is it also saving that design into the express project in the database? ","pastedContents":{},"timestamp":1759119165832,"project":"/Users/tylerboyd/Development/restoration_apparel_company"}
{"display":"And that will be in the existing express projects, so the designs is an array inside the project info, it's the same express project object that we are using in the front end to track state of the project right?","pastedContents":{},"timestamp":1759119277532,"project":"/Users/tylerboyd/Development/restoration_apparel_company"}
{"display":"Alright great. Real last question, this seems perfect for the \"generate new design\" flow, but what about the \"modify design\" and \"create matching\" flows that we had in our previous rendition of the express-creator?","pastedContents":{},"timestamp":1759119340411,"project":"/Users/tylerboyd/Development/restoration_apparel_company"}

{"display":"Let's do a combo of 1 and 3 here. Also, can you change the resto-api routes for our flow? I want them to match our others, just starting with /v1?","pastedContents":{},"timestamp":1759119567344,"project":"/Users/tylerboyd/Development/restoration_apparel_company"}

{"display":"Great, just for future use, can we add to our generate-spec command in the global claude directory that I want to track all our spec todos in this way? Tell it where the blue folder is, tell it what commands to run to create these? And then as apart of the generate-spec, coudl we make sure it creates specs that have a section that explain that as we finish tasks, we move the records along and eventually into the done list? I basically want us to track our major tasks there, and then as we work, I want to move the tasks into the proper lists, and I want you to be able to do that all without me asking every time. How could I do that, based on how we work together now in this spec driven development flow I've build into claude?","pastedContents":{},"timestamp":1759120568642,"project":"/Users/tylerboyd/Development/restoration_apparel_company"}
